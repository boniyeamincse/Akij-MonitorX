# Akij MonitorX Architecture

## Overview
Akij MonitorX is a monitoring system designed to track and manage services within the Akij Group environment. It utilizes Docker for containerization and provides real-time monitoring capabilities.

## High-Level Architecture

### Components
1. **Monitoring Agents**: Deployed on target systems to collect metrics and logs.
2. **Central Server**: Aggregates data from agents and provides a dashboard for visualization.
3. **Database**: Stores historical data and configuration settings.
4. **API Gateway**: Handles external API requests and authentication.

### Data Flow
- Agents collect data from monitored systems.
- Data is sent to the central server via secure channels.
- Server processes and stores data in the database.
- Dashboard queries the database for real-time and historical views.

## Docker Architecture
The system is containerized using Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling.

- **Services**:
  - monitor-agent: Lightweight agent service
  - monitor-server: Main application server
  - postgres: Database for persistence
  - nginx: Web server for dashboard

- **Networks**: Isolated networks for security and performance.

## Security Considerations
- Encrypted communication between components.
- Role-based access control for users.
- Regular security updates and patches.

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of agents based on load.
- Database sharding for large data volumes.
- Load balancing for high availability.

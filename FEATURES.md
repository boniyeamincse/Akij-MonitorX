## Overview
Akij MonitorX is a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform designed to provide real-time insights into IT infrastructure, leveraging AI-powered anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and intelligent reporting for proactive system management.

## 🖥️ Real-Time Monitoring
Comprehensive system monitoring capabilities to ensure continuous visibility into infrastructure health.

- **System Metrics Collection**: Automated collection of CPU, RAM, disk, network, and database metrics from all servers using Zabbix agents.
- **Service Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of critical services including Nginx, MySQL, Redis, and other application components.
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Lightweight agents deployed across servers for efficient data gathering without impacting performance.
- **Real-Time Data Streams**: Immediate data transmission to central server for live dashboard updates via Socket.IO.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Anomaly Detection
Advanced machine learning algorithms to identify and alert on abnormal system behavior before issues escalate.

- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised machine learning algorithm for detecting outliers and anomalous patterns in system metrics.
- **LSTM Autoencoder**: Deep learning neural network specialized in time-series anomaly detection, learning normal behavior patterns to flag deviations.
- **Prophet Model**: Facebook's forecasting library for trend analysis and prediction of seasonal patterns in system metrics.
- **Historical Data Integration**: Utilizes Zabbix time-series data for continuous model training and improvement.

## 📈 Predictive Analytics
Forward-looking insights to anticipate and prevent system issues.

- **Resource Usage Forecasting**: Predicts future CPU, RAM, and storage consumption trends.
- **System Failure Risk Assessment**: Quantifies likelihood of system downtimes based on current metrics and historical patterns.
- **Capacity Planning Support**: Provides data-driven insights for infrastructure scaling decisions.

## 🚨 Intelligent Alert Management
Smart alerting system that reduces noise while ensuring critical issues are addressed promptly.

- **AI-Based Prioritization**: Automatically categorizes alerts as Critical, Warning, or Low priority using machine learning.
- **Alert Fatigue Reduction**: Filters redundant alerts and focuses on actionable notifications.
- **Automated Routing**: Directs alerts to appropriate teams via email, Slack, Telegram, or other channels through Alert Manager integration.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
Automated diagnostics to accelerate problem resolution.

- **Metric Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between different system metrics to pinpoint root causes.
- **Automated Diagnosis**: Provides suggested remediation steps based on detected anomalies.
- **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Compares current issues against past incidents for faster troubleshooting.

## 📊 Smart Reporting
Comprehensive reporting capabilities for compliance, auditing, and performance tracking.

- **Automated PDF Reports**: Generates detailed reports highlighting anomalies, trends, and system health.
- **Scheduled Deliveries**: Configurable daily/weekly reports sent via email or integrated into dashboards.
- **Customizable Templates**: Flexible reporting formats tailored to different stakeholder needs.

## 💬 Chatbot Integration
Natural language interface for intuitive system queries and operations.

- **Natural Language Queries**: English-based commands like "Show me CPU usage for Server-01" or "What's the current disk space on Database-02".
- **CLI and REST API**: Multiple interface options for different use cases and integrations.
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides relevant data and insights based on current system state.

## 🐳 Containerized Deployment
Enterprise-ready deployment options for scalability and reliability.

- **Docker Compose Integration**: Full-stack deployment including Zabbix, Grafana, AI Engine, and Alert Manager.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular components that can be scaled independently.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) and Windows environments.

## 🎨 Visualization Dashboard
Powerful web-based interface for monitoring and analytics.

- **Grafana Integration**: Rich dashboards with customizable panels and alerts.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live data visualization with automatic refresh capabilities.
- **Multi-Source Data**: Unified view combining Zabbix metrics, AI predictions, and custom KPIs.

## 🔧 Extensibility and Integration
Open architecture designed for customization and third-party integrations.

- **RESTful APIs**: Programmatic access to all monitoring data and AI insights.
- **Webhook Support**: Integration with external systems for automated workflows.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible framework for adding custom monitoring checks and AI models.

## 🔒 Security and Compliance
Built-in security features to protect sensitive infrastructure data.

- **Encrypted Communications**: Secure data transmission between agents and servers.
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for different user types and teams.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of system access and changes for compliance reporting.
